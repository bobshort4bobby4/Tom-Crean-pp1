            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <article>Thomas Crean born on 20 July 1877 (date disputed) into a small
                holding in the townland of Gurtuchane near Annascaul village.  Annascaul
                is located on the Dingle penninsula just to the east of the town of Dingle.
                His parents, Catherine and Patrick had a total of eleven children and life would
                have been extremely tough for Crean as he grew-up. Crean left school at the 
                age of tweleve and started to help his parents on the farm.  Several of 
                his older brothers had emigrated and it was perhaps no surprise that the 
                independantly-minded younster enlisted in the Royal Navy just short of his
                16th birthday. In July 1893 he started the journey to Queenstown (Cobh) ,in
                a borrowed suit, to enlist at the rank of Boy: 2nd Class.

            <h2>Discovery Expedition 1901-1904.</h2>
            <article>Crean's first posting was at Plymouth in south-West England.
                Despite the harsh conditions and strict regime he did reasonably 
                well in the Navy and shortly before his 19th birthday was promoted 
                to Able Seaman.There followed a series of postings to several ships,
                another promotion (Petty Officer, 2nd Class, September 1899). The posting
                that would dicate the course of his life came in February 1900 when he joined
                HMS Ringarooma in New Zealand.  Scott's ship Discovery was docked in the same 
                port as Crean whilst he, Scott was stocked his ship for the long voyage south
                . One of the Discovery's crew 
                 desserted and Crean, always the adventurer volunteered to take his place.
                 The Discovery set sail on 24th December 1901 for Antartica and  although the expedition failed 
                 to reach the pole, valuable scientific and geographical work was achieved.

            <h2>Terra Nova Expedition 1910-1913.</h2>
            <article>Crean had proved his worth on the Discovery expedition and Scott recommended
                him for a promotion. Crean served with Scott
                on several ships untill 1910 when they joined the British Antarctic Expedition 
                 on board the Terra Nova. They set sail once again, south, in June 1910. Crean
                                  again proved his worth and was part of the party which pushed for the Pole
                 in November 1911. He reached 87Â°32'S (168 miles short) before being ordered to return
                 back to Mcmurdo Sound. It was on this journey back that Crean had to undertake 
                 an unprecedented solo journey.  In order to summon help for his colleague LT
                Evans who was severly ill with scurvy, Crean undertook to march the last 35 miles to
                Mcmurdo Sound. He completed the trip in 18 hours and  without douth
                saved the lives of his two companions for which he was awarded the Albert medal.

            <h2>Endurance 1914-1916 Expedition </h2>
            <article>Crean didn't to wait too long before joining Shackleton on another journey.  On the fifth of December 1914 they left South Georgia with a plan
                to cross the continent, however by mid January the ship was stuck fast in the Weddel pack ice. The ship drifted for months untill finally sinking
                in November.  In April the next year they were able to launch the three small lifeboats to attempt the hazardous 5 day journey to Elephant Island. Elephant Island proved to be a poor refuge with
                little hope of rescue, so it was decided to attempt the 800 mile crossing back to South Georgia. After battling huge seas the 
                party of 6 men reached the un-inhabited side of the island 17 days later. Crean, Shackleton and Worsley had to cross the 'tremendously broken' interior to reach
                an inhabited whaling station and thereby arrange relief ships first for the other side of the island and later Elephant Island.

            <h2>"Tom the Pole" -life after the navy.</h2>
            <article>Crean returned to England when the Endeavour expedition broke up( 8th October 1916 in Argentina).  The First World War was ongoing and Crean went back into the Navy.
                 He served on several ships as Acting Boatswain but had a comparatively safe war.  He briefly returned to Annascaul on 5th September 1917 to marry Eileen Herlihy, who was the daughter 
                 of a local publican.He stayed in the Navy until 24th March 1920 when he was invalided out due to defective
                  vision. His eyesight problems stemmed from a fall he had taken on board HMS Fox, he had fallen down a hatchway and suffered a heavy blow to his right temple. 
                   He retired from the Navy to Annascaul and despite several offers to join 
                 expeditions he never travelled again.  He died from an infection he acquired when his appendix burst on 27th July 1938 in Cork, aged 61.
