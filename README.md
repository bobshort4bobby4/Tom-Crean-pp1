# Introduction

This website is designed to provide easily accessible information pertaining to Tom Crean, the antarctic explorer.
It is aimed at a general audience but will be particularly useful for students doing projects.
It does not, at this time, seek to give a comprehensive account of his life but does provide links to
other resources for users who wish to know more.

  ### Design
  
  ##### Colour Scheme 
  There are two main colours used in the site namely 'antarctic blue'(#2b3f5c), and an off-white 'snow' (#fffafa).<br> These colours contrast well and are a good fit thematically.
  Black is used to darken some of the images. These two colours are used as borders to define both text and image panels.

  Snow White             ![](https://github.com/bobshort4bobby4/Tom-Crean-pp1/blob/main/assets/images/snow-border.png)
  ##### Typography
  There are two font families used, "PT serif,serif" for the main text and "Pacifico, cursive" for the links.
  
  ##### Images
  Images of Antarctia are used as backgrounds for all pages, these images are both visually pleasing and informative.<br>
  All other images are used to add both visual and intellectual interest. Freeconvert.com was used to convert image files 
  to the .webp format.
  
  ### WireFrames
  
  There are two sets of wireframes provided here, the original set which were produced at the planning stage and the set which reflects the finished design.<br>
  As I implemented the design I found the original design was not tenable.  Certain images were not scalable either becoming extremely pixelated or having to be cropped excessively to maintain image quality. Consequently I changed the layout of both the text panels and choice of images at certain screen sizes.  All these changes are included within the second set of wireframes as well as landscape mode wireframes.<br>

# Features

<details>
  
  <summary>Features</summary>
  
  #### Responsive Website
  
  Media queries are used to ensure the website is easy to view at a full range of screen sizes and in landscape mode.
  A hamburger-style navigation menu is used at mobile phone screen sizes.  This satisfies the user requirment to be able 
  to easily navigate the site.<br><br>
  
  ![mobile landscape](https://github.com/bobshort4bobby4/Tom-Crean-pp1/blob/main/assets/images/screenshots/gallert-landscape.png)

  #### Headers and Footers 
  
  Both the Header and Footer are styled consistently throughtout the site and are fixed in position.  The header displays the tag-line
  and an iconic image of the subject as well as navigation links, in larger screen sizes as a bar and in small sizes as a Hamburger-style button.
  The Footer provides links to various social media sites.
  
  #### Information Accessibility
  
  One of the User goals is to easily access relevant information, to this end the bulk of the site information is displayed on the landing page, with a list of easily 
  assimilable facts available on the second page.<br><br>
  
  ![home page](https://github.com/bobshort4bobby4/Tom-Crean-pp1/blob/main/assets/images/screenshots/homepage.png)

  #### Sliding Gallery
  
  A sliding gallery is implemented to display relevant pictures.  The gallery is sized appropiately for the screen size and is interacted with via two arrows.
  Tool tips are available for each image.
  The gallery is an attempt to engage the visitor and ensure they have a positive experience.<br><br>
  <br>

  #### Links Page
  
  The Links page meets the users possible need to find more information about the subject.  It provides two video links, a link to the Crean Wikipedia page and a contact
  form.  Presently the submit button on the contact form links to a placeholder page.
  
  #### Future Additions
  
  There are several other features/enhancements I would like to implement in the future as time resources/knowledge become available.
  
  1. The header takes up too much space in landscape mode.  I would like to reduce the height of the header and hide/reduce the header image.
    This should aid ease of use.
  1. The image number on the sliding gallery would be replaced with an informative caption specific to each slide. This should aid effectiveness.
  1. The contact form should be styled and the submit button linked to mailing list.
  1. An interactive element could be introduced in the form of a on-line quiz.
  1. Animation could be introduced as, for example, a moving timeline/route-marker.

# Testing
<details>
  <summary>Testing</summary>
  
  #### Lighthouse
  Each page of the website was tested using the Lighthouse tool included in the Chrome browser.
  The lowest score using lighthouss was 88 for Performance which occured on the first loading of the Gallery page.  It improved to
  low 90's on subsequent loads (I presume because images are cached ?).<br><br>
  ![Lighthouse](https://github.com/bobshort4bobby4/Tom-Crean-pp1/blob/main/assets/images/screenshots/lighthouseresult1.png)
  <br><hr><br>
  #### W3C CSS Validator
  The CSS used in to style the website was validated using the W3c service and returned no errors.<br>
  ![css validation](https://github.com/bobshort4bobby4/Tom-Crean-pp1/blob/main/assets/images/screenshots/Css-valid-result.png)
  <br><hr><br>
  #### W3c HTML Validator
  Each page was tested using the W3c html validation servive, returning no errors.<br>
  ![html validator result](https://github.com/bobshort4bobby4/Tom-Crean-pp1/blob/main/assets/images/screenshots/html-result.png)
  <br><hr><br>
  #### WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool
  Testing using the Wave tool produced no errors and a contrast ratio of 8.59<br>
  ![wave result](https://github.com/bobshort4bobby4/Tom-Crean-pp1/blob/main/assets/images/screenshots/wave-result.png)
  <br><hr><br>
  #### Manual Testing
  Website was tested using the Chrome and Edge browsers as well as on machines of varying screen sizes.<br>
  All internal and external links work, external links open on a new tab.<br>
  Youtube links do not auto-play on loading, controls work and will play on full screen.<br>
  Inputs on contact form are validating data correctly and submit button is linking to placeholder page.<br>
  <br>
  #### Known Issues
  On landscape mode at small screen sizes the header is too large, it makes the user scroll the page too frequently. This negatively affects UX.<br><br>
  There are some discrepansies appearing with the font size in the header between different pages at the same screen size.  This is due I think to how I used grids to layout
  the pages, It may have been a better option to only use grids for the home page main section and flex box for the simpler layouts.<br><br>
  On smaller mobile screens the content is not appearing as indicated in Chrome Dev Tools, I believe this is due to the address bar on the mobile.
  Content position would need to be adjusted to compensate for this.<br><br>
  I failed to fully implement advice from my mentor regarding my use of github and the labelling of my commits. Although I feel that this has improved towards the end of
  the project,  commits becoming more frequent and more specific. It is one (of many) areas I will make an effort to improve as I move forwards.<br><br>

  #### Code
  The sliding gallery feature was based on one available on the W3s tutorial site. [www.w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow_gallery.asp)<br>
  The hamburger navigation menu was modeled on a You-tube tutorial by Tyler Potts.[www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFKBep95lb4)<br>
  The method of creating a circular image was learned from the 'Love Running ' project on the Code Institute course.<br>
  Thanks are also due to both my mentors Can Sucullu and Ben Kavanagh who were both most helpful.<br>
