# Introduction

This website is designed to provide easily accessible information pertaining to Tom Crean, the antarctic explorer.
It is aimed at a general audience but will be particularly useful for students doing projects.
It does not, at this time, seek to give a comprehensive account of his life but does provide links to
other resources for users who wish to know more.

  ### Design
  
  ##### Colour Scheme 
  There are two main used in the site namely antarctic blue(#2b3f5c), and an off-white (#ebe9e6).<br> These colours contrast well and are a good fit thematically.
  Black is used to darken some of the images. These two colours are used as borders to define both text and image panels.
  
  ##### Typography
  There are two font families used, "PT serif,serif" for the main text and "Pacifico, cursive" for the links.
  
  ##### Images
  Images of Antarctia is used as backgrounds for all pages, these images are both visually pleasing and informative.<br>
  All other images are used to add both visual and intellectual interest. Freeconvert.com was used to convert image files 
  to the .webp format.
  
  ### WireFrames
  
  There are two sets of wireframes provided here, the original set which were produced at the planning stage and the set which reflects the finished design.<br>
  As I implemented the design I found the original design was not tenable.  Certain images were not scalable either becoming extremely pixelated or having to be cropped excessively to maintain image quality. Consequently I changed the layout of both the text panels and choice of images at certain screen sizes.  All these changes are included within the second set of wireframes as well as landscape mode wireframes.<br>
